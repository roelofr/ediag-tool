# Electricity Diagram Tool

This tool is meant to be used for domestic electricity diagrams. 
It's goals are to render a consistent electricity diagram for your home, where you can add junction boxes, light 
switches and power outlets, as well as some additional diagrams.

It's inspired by how PlantUML makes diagrams, but strictly for domestic use.

Wanted features:

- A legible format for rendering electricity diagrams
- Usage of existing rendering tooling (dotvis?) to render diagrams to images
- Consistent output, so no jumping diagrams

Future wishes include:

- Validating electricity diagrams
- Support for keeping track of contact with earth
